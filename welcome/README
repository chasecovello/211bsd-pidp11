Disclaimer: I originally found this program for VAX/VMS systems in
the March 1988 issue of Hardcopy magazine (page 83).  I do not credit
the idea to me, but since the actual program was in VMS command form,
I deided it would be nice to put it on an Ultrix compatible system.
This program is intended to be shareware.

Welcome prints out a nice welcome message for the user.

Version 1: Initial program translated, debugged.  At this time there is only
a set message in the middle box.  Future copies should work so that it will
nlist the kernel and find the type of VAX and version of Ultrix.

Version 2: Added load average box and LOAD define in cpu.h

Version 3: Added CPU type and CPU define, along with Ultrix version and
hostname.

** This program translated from VMS command language by Jim King at lsrhs
** (And added a few extra features...)

NOTES --

Define LOAD if you want the little load average box

Define CPU If you want to know the type of CPU you are using.

Define LIGHT if you want the messages in the box highlighted.

Define UVERS If you want to know the version of Ultrix.
	NOTE: This program assumes that /etc/motd is a known file
	      produced by /etc/rc.
